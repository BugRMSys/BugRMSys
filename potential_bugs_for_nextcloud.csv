85587398,External Storage Errors Passed from Server to Mobile (Android),"As an ownCloud administrator, I would like a mechanism to pass external storage credential errors to the mobile clients so that users on their devices can address any problems with external storage, and continue to use ownCloud even after an error (in conjunction with: owncloud/core#16306 )

Acceptance Criteria:
- The error needs to be able to identify a problem with external storage and pass an error that does not cause the client to delete the directory, rather a temporary error that notifies the user that the directory is not syncing
- All errors are assumed to be temporary network or credential issues, rather than permanent failures
  - If external storage is permanently affected, the admin will have to remove it (or the user, if it is a personal mount) to resolve the errors
- The error needs to specifically identify the kind of problem (such as a credentials error), server not found error, etc
- The error also needs to specify a path so that the error can be addressed by the clients (such as opening a browser to the appropriate URL) and then allowing the user to resolve the issue. The error cannot be assumed to be in the root directory, as external storage can be moved around inside owncloud

iOS Version: https://github.com/owncloud/ios/issues/382

Desktop Version: https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/3308

LONGER TERM:
The desktop clients would provide a communications path for passing messages to and from ownCloud clients (such as a credentials error AND a built in login screen) - so a general class of error that can be reused would be a good concept here. Related: owncloud/core#16772

169769062,"Auto upload, exif problem","### Actual behaviour

When the app automatically upload a picture after it's been taken, the exif of the image file indicate the date of the upload, not the original date and time of the picture.

If the upload succeed imediately after the photo shoot, there is not big problem. But when the upload fails, the exif of the image indicate the datetime of the retried upload, not the original exif.
### Expected behaviour

The exif of an uploaded image should always be the original one. Else, it mess up the order and the chronology and it's a problem.

43808834,"Changing the password causes no more refreshes and failing photo sync, which only re-install will fix","I just changed the password of my ownCloud account.

After that, on my android device, I tried changing the password for the ownCloud account. That seemed to be easy enough, and my new password was accepted without problems. After that, however, the ownCloud android client was constantly complaining about a ""failed synchronisation"" for the instant upload images. Also when navigating inside the owncloud app, even though some folder content was shown, it seemed to be outdated, as of most folders the subfolders (especially those I had never loaded before) were empty, and the spinner on the top never stopped turning (even for the folders where some content was shown).

Is there any log to check for the case when such problems happen?

I tried setting the password multiple times, I'm sure it was the correct one, it never worked

I then tried removing the account and recreating it, which also didn't change anything.

Next I tried ""force stopping"" the app and removing all its data, which also didn't help.

At last, I tried uninstalling and reinstalling the client (and the JellyBean workaround app, which still seems to be required on 4.4, correct?), and after recreating the account then, it finally worked again.

Anybody else seen this? Any log or so I can check for details as to why the simple password change procedure didn't work in my case?

Note: I didn't specifically check the version before reinstalling, but since automatic upgrades are enabled, I suppose it was the version 1.5.8 of the app before and after re-installation.

I'm currently trying a second password change to see if this behavior is reproducible in my environment. Edit: Not reproducible at the moment. So I'm closing this issue. Maybe it will be a guidance for others having a similar experience...

7991808,Files like File_conflict_TIMESTAMP.txt  when editing files on the Android device (Jota Text Editor),"While testing the behaviour of down- and uploads with a single file File.txt for editing, I now noticed a spooky file File_conflict_20121030_084503.txt on the Android. 

I use
- server 4.5.1a
- Android 1.3.14
- Jota Text Editor (Android) with enabled setting to use abackup version when editing. This editor creates a backup file with filename File.txt~ . 

Perhaps this backup file (renaming, swapping names of current and backup version ???) is causing the reported issue. In previous tests I disabled the backup file creation in the Jota Text Editor settings and everything (editing on the server, editing in Windows client and editing on the Android device) appeared to work fine, at least I did not notice problems when synchronising the Android client manually - for this see https://github.com/bartoszprzybylski/owncloud-android/issues/43 )

The Delete button however only offers to the delete this particular file on the server(!).

The Windows client does not show such a file in the file list.

Questions:
- Please can you explain why the Android client offers ""delete on the server"" ?
- Should the text become ""delete locally"" because there is no File_conflict_TIMESTAMP.txt on the server but a conflicting backup file File.txt~ locally ? [UPDATE] I think I was wrong. The file is indeed on the server.
- This exact local file name (File.txt~) should be listed locally in the Android client, or File.txt~___conflict_TIMESTAMP [UPDATE]
  I think I was wrong. The file is indeed on the server.

The problem is that relying only on using ""share"" actions is that you end up with duplicate files (one in your Owncloud synced files, one in, say, your ""downloads"" directory). Also, as I said, it's inconsistent with other clients and counter intuitive (why does that file display in my sync directory but not in the Owncloud app?)

2. Take a picture.
3. The picture is not uploaded - and does not show in the Uploads section.

An example of this is Starbucks:  all of their WiFi SSIDs are ""ATT Wifi"" (or something similar). My phone remembers this SSID and happily connects to the network.

I can choose ""YES"" to trust that certificate, of course, but this behaviour is still irritating and annoying.

### Expected behaviour
-Trust the server certs that are trusted as per installed root certs in settings->security->trusted credentials
 
### Steps to reproduce
1. Remove owncloud account in android owncloud client (this is to remove the current app-private server cert store `knownServers.bks`)
2. Reinstall android owncloud client
3. Connect to an https ownloud server which uses a server certificate that is trusted as per installed root certs in settings->security->trusted credentials.

337823384,App cannot open folders with name that contains a space,"### Actual behaviour
-Tell us what happens
When trying to open folder or upload to folders containing space in their name, the app fails to do so. For example opening folder ""My Files"" will not work, whereas ""My-Files"" will be opened.

Instead, all file sizes should be shown in MB, and exactly one decimal unit (even 5.0 for 5). Differing from the web interface though we should show the Â»MBÂ« unit after each value though because there is no table heading.

For sizes below 0.1 MB, show Â»<0.1 MBÂ« _ because a file below that size will be downloaded instantly anyway, almost regardless of network. For sizes above 1000 MB, show Â»>1000 MBÂ«, because a file above that size will take a looong time to download (the exact size and progress should be shown on the download bar screen as feedback).

- **Closed beta**: to run a test with small groups or if **we know the exact users we want to test** the ownCloud app. Users in this test group can be managed by email address and only they will receive updates for the beta version (via link).
- **Open beta:** to run a test with a large group, **anyone can join the beta program** and submit private feedback. Since ownCloud app is in live production version, users can opt-in to the beta program from the app details in Play Store (It's possible to set a maximum number of beta testers)

In none of the options, testers can submit public reviews. 

## AC
- [x] Decide: closed or open beta // **Open beta**
- [x] Decide Feedback channel (let the users know how they can provide us with feedback): email address, private feedback through Play Store (only for open beta), github repository, central. // **Apps email**
- [x] Prepare beta release
- - [x] Create open release beta in Play Store.

just an idea:
My whatsapp folder is growing and growing and consuming lots of (rare) memory.
So the idea is to extend the instantupload to watch any folder that we specify.

With this all whatsapp images/videos will automatically be uploaded to owncloud. When I have no memory left I can go to owncloud and say ""delete local files"" on the whatsapp folder.
(And via root explorer I can delete all folders/images in /data/whatsapp).

Later it would be great if the files are not copied but remain on the original storage path.
Then it would be possible to delete the whatsapp images from within owncloud app, which would be a great benefit for all users that do not have root or do not know that files are duplicated (but this is another issue, that already exists: #346 ).

What do you think? Or do you have a better idea to solve this?

256598248,Username normalization in owncloud beta (2.5.1-beta 1) prevents login with ldap user,"### Actual behaviour
- Username is altered (or normalized) automatically after first login. Space is changed to underscore.

### Expected behaviour
-Username should not be altered.  
 
### Steps to reproduce
1. Install owncloud latest beta. (Hint: Same behavior with latest nextcloud dev-version) 
2. Login with username containing a space. [Here authentication is done against LDAP server]. First login works, but app (almost) instantly redirects back to login screen, where you have to login again. But: 
3. Username is changed from 'Firstname Lastname' to 'Firstname_Lastname' and the username field can't be modified, so the username can't be changed and the user can't authenticate against LDAP server. User is locked out and has to reinstall app.

### Note
Username is not changed with latest ownCloud stable (2.4.0) (or latest nextcloud).

### Workaround
[Only works in nextcloud-dev:] Also configure to login with Email-Account as login attribute in LDAP. Username is changed as described above in app, but login is done with Email-Address. 
**Update**: After some time, nextcloud decided to change my username from username@mailserver.com@owcloudserver.com to user_name@owncoudserver.com. 
Conclusion: Some recent change in the owncloud and nextcloud app changes the login account to the username in owncloud. But this is not necessarily my login username. 
Now it seems, that oc and nextcloud share a recent code change. All the time, I wished that both Teams work together to fix the instant upload issue. Now I wish, that they did not work together. :-)

However,  most of the time the share fails,  since the owncloud app does not know how to handle the data.  This is really frustrating.  The most advantage purpose of having access to the owncloud server on an android device is the point that one is able to add very quickly content.. Owncloud on the go... 

The Owncloud app should therefore try to handle as much shared data as possible.  If there are multiple ways,  it could offer a selection.  E.g. saving as txt or odt. 
Furthermore,  the settings could define standard saving options.  E.g. Save in the folder notes/income/ save as $date-time-app-name.  
It should be possible to save text,  images,  videos, links,  html,  etc.  
An example how such a saving method could work would be the save dialogs of the firefox webbrowser, where one can simply save as default by a single click or allow customized saving settings.

41967476,"After a manually accepted certificate on an owncloud server is updated, the android app stops communicating with the server","I am running the android app version 1.5.8. I am running an SSL-enabled owncloud server supported by a CA, that is not in the trusted CA list of my android device, so I had to manually accept the certificate in my owncloud client.

I recently updated the certificate on my server to a new certificate by the same CA. I noticed that the file listing on my android client wasn't updated anymore. When trying to manually update the list, I get a busy icon for less than a second, but my file list doesn't update. No warning message was shown in the user interface. After I set the password for this account again (which wasn't changed), I got a certificate warning message again. After having accepted the new certificate here, I could again use my owncloud account.

I assume that if the server certificate doesn't match, the connection is silently dropped and no warning is shown to the user. I suggest to show the certificate warning dialog here again instead of silently dropping the connection.

@eriktews I (@rperezb) edit your issue to have a better tracking of the scope and expectations:

STEPS:
- Having a ssl self signed cert installed on the ownCloud server
- Install the Android app and log in accepting the cert
- From the server side, change the cert
- Do any action on the Android app such as refresh

CURRENT STATUS:
- The app stop working, every request to the server fails

EXPECTED BEHAVIOUR:
- When this change is detected, we will show a similar popup to the one shown when you accept the cert for the first time
- This is detected when the current folder is refreshed, similar behavior to the case when the credentials have changed
- if any upload fails due to the change of the certificate the error shown will be: connection error

- later on the mobile app told me again about a conflict, not sure why. I simply told it to use the server version (IIRC it was on Wednesday 14th)

### Environment data

### More information

There are two tokens involved:
- ""408c3ef82e3450d5791bd570199c3b1c0d68a5a1459df4fc574f7dc4d90ec001113d254a3d1d807f2251bc2c5d52f1d939a64709bacfdb52b9fac41386502e0d"" is the token associated to the app password which I called ""nokia-oc"" in the server
- ""4b72207608f411692af037fe9bc8bb767c59216f495e3ff20e6689055ed3f7c7a05e9a4f37731f3fe1218a850ee31081fdab4fb5ff08c99fe8c96ebed84b4c63"" is another mysterious token.

Around the time where the auth seem to have dissapeared, the log looks like this:
```
{""reqId"":""0abb7fc5-f3ac-4a27-8d86-db87a261599a"",""level"":0,""time"":""2018-11-14T15:07:52+00:00"",""remoteAddr"":""77.190.150.229"",""user"":""--"",""app"":""OC\\User\\Session::checkTokenCredentials"",""method"":""PROPFIND"",""url"":""\/remote.php\/dav\/files\/vincent\/clientsync\/work\/pomodoro.md"",""message"":""checking credentials for token 408c3ef82e3450d5791bd570199c3b1c0d68a5a1459df4fc574f7dc4d90ec001113d254a3d1d807f2251bc2c5d52f1d939a64709bacfdb52b9fac41386502e0d with token id 96027, last check at 1542205654 was more than 5 min ago""}

```

and matching access log entries:
```
x.x.x.x - vincent - [14/Nov/2018:16:07:52 +0100] ""PROPFIND /remote.php/dav/files/vincent/clientsync/work/pomodoro.md HTTP/1.1"" 207 895 ""-"" ""Mozilla/5.0 (Android) ownCloud-android/2.9.1""
x.x.x.x - vincent - [14/Nov/2018:16:07:53 +0100] ""PROPFIND /remote.php/dav/files/vincent/clientsync/work/pomodoro.md HTTP/1.1"" 401 270 ""-"" ""Mozilla/5.0 (Android) ownCloud-android/2.9.1""
```

It looks like during normal operation, the Android client will use the correct token ""nokia-oc"" when connecting to the server. We can see that it was able to PROPFIND the ""pomodoro.md"" file with success.
However, for some strange reason, the above request is followed by another PROPFIND that uses the ""mysterious token"" instead and receives a 401 error.

The ""mysterious token"" stopped existing on the server already since October, more than a month ago:
```
{""reqId"":""r.=VqbU=DSt9rR2B\/akiPeRk"",""level"":0,""time"":""2018-10-19T11:41:50+00:00"",""remoteAddr"":""2.247.253.227"",""user"":""--"",""app"":""OC\\Authentication\\Token\\DefaultTokenProvider::getToken"",""method"":""PROPFIND"",""url"":""\/remote.php\/dav\/files\/vincent\/clientsync\/"",""message"":""token d745719c898742aef10b97962154ad2258285efd9ddb5d42947dec3391d4171b2f1f7554bf73df3a9f959397aa7b2fa816fc5cb618748700490546aa9e9c7468 does not exist""}
```

So to me it looks like the Android client somehow still remembers that old token and here decided to use it again. Due to the 401 failure, it interpreted this as a ""total auth failure"".

When attempting to repeat the auth, it now continues to use the ""mysterious token"" instead of ""nokia-oc"".

I'm not sure whether this is related to the conflict situation or not. Maybe inspect the code paths related to conflict requests and see if it's using the right token. Also not clear why it would switch back to this old token.

Is there a way to inspect the app's internal database to see if this token was still stored somewhere ?
Sadly I now reconfigured the account by entering a new app password, so not sure if there is any info to recover for debugging.

Also, interestingly, now that the app can connect again, it once again tells me about conflicts on the ""pomodoro.md"" file... there could be another bug there.

Steps to reproduce:

3. Install the Collabora OpenOffice Android app if it isn't already installed.
4. Tap on the OpenDocument file in the ownCloud client.  Select Collabora from the suggested list of apps to open the file.
5. Edit the file and save it.
6. ownCloud will not upload the edits to the server.  Pulling down to refresh also does not initiate a transfer.
7. Opening the file again shows that the edits were saved, indicating that the updated file exists locally.

This functionality used to work with prior versions of ownCloud, and there is nothing inherent in scoped storage and the Storage Access Framework that should prevent this from working now.

The Owncloud file client on Android and iPad doesn't show files, that were deleted on the server before.

The Owncloud file client on Android and iPad shows the last file, that was deleted on the server before. Trying to access that file from the Android/iPad client results in an error message, that either the file is broken or doesn't exist.
It works after a while and I assume, because I closed and reopened the ownCloud site in my browser on the server.

1. On the server delete some files in the browser.
2. In the Android or iPad ownCloud client hit 'Refresh'

78961300,MATERIAL DESIGN: As an OC user I want that the new list & grid components from Material Design replace the current so that performance is improved in folders with hundreds of files & images,"Google states that the new elements for lists and grid view included in the Android Support Library help to improve the performance of lists and grids with tons of elements. I couldn't check it, but it's obvious they _enforce_ the recycling of views instead of simply allowing the option to do it (or the option to forget to do it and have problems; see #955 fixing it). If there is also a better recycling policy behind, we will only notice it by start using them.

Nevertheless, there are other important reasons to embrace this change:
- The GridView widget currently in use is a mess; it's not fully implemented in all the Android versions (even in different 4,x versions). This fact already caused crashes in the past, and is still enforcing some undesired graphical effect in older 4.x devices (my lips are sealed). Using the new Grid element in Android Support Library we will have a single and complete implementation for all our grids.
- Both components are needed if we want to take advantage of new elements for cool animations in Material Design. 

Sure of interest for @tobiasKaminsky , @jancborchardt , and everybody is welcome.

Just please, remember, that #692  should be done first (or at least the part of the build target).

Expected behavior:

Pictures should not be gray or blurry with different colors

Actual Behavior:

As I quite surely never will need them on my mobile phone and they make the indexing of the whole folder structure a quite lengthy process it would be nice to tell the app to exclude some folders from syncing or indexing.

This could maybe be achieved similar to the way which k9mail goes: there one can set folders as main folders that are automatically synced with every sync process and other folders, where only the folder structure itself is indexed. If you enter one of the latter folders theres a button that lets one load the content of the folder if needed.

By this one could restrict the folders that one needs to be synced or indexed on the mobile phone and therefore keep syncing/indexing times short and battery saving.

i searched the forums and found similar problems but no real fix for it.
I have a Galaxy S4 and Owncloud installed on Linux. The owncloud is functioning fine, i can login with the App on Samsung S3, S2 and Webdav on win7 and with webbrowsers.
So the problems doesnt seem to be in the server but on the S4. The S4 has Android version 4.3 on it. What happens is, as soon as i open the App (after i put in the server and password) a blank screen comes with the little Cloud in the Top and thats it. After that it does nothing. Does anyone has any ideas on how to fix this ? Thank you very much for your response in advance. 
And i already tried de-install and re-install etc.

2. Look up the directory in which I want to upload it
3. Open OwnCloud app, browse to that directory and open uploaded file and get shareable link
4. Paste to IM

It would be really great to have option to directly share something to predefined directory and shareable public link will be added to clipboard automatically. So there will be another ""OwnCloud share link"" option in Share via menu.

34941953,[1.5.7] Automatic upload over Wi-FI jumped to cellular,"Traveled abroad yesterday and noticed something strange with the automatic upload of pictures. My default setting is to only upload when connected to Wi-Fi. All was well until I connected my phone to the airport network that requires me too start the browser and accept the TOS. Only after that do I get a connection to the Internet.

What happened was that before I had a chance to accept the TOS, ownCloud started to try and upload 400 images (3-400MB in total) that I took during my visit. And of course the upload failed. But after accepting the TOS, the upload worked. And then it was time for me to board my flight and I switched off Wi-Fi and expected the upload to stop, but no, instead the upload jumped over to the cellular network and started to eat away my precious 20 MB/day quota when I__ abroad. Managed to switch off the cellular network and the uploads started to fail, after killing the app in the Android settings did the madness stop.

Android did notify me when I connected to the airport Wi-Fi that I needed to sign in/accept the TOS. Is it possible to get the ownCloud app to halt the upload until there actually is a working connection to the Internet and not just a connection to a local Wi-Fi/AP network? It should try to __ing_ the server and see if it gets a valid response back before starting the automatic upload.
#### Expected behaviour

Upload should have stopped when the Wi-Fi connection was turned off. 
#### Actual behaviour

When Wi-Fi was turned off, the ownCloud resumed the automatic upload over the cellular network instead of just stop the upload and wait for a Wi-Fi connection.

An interesting feature to include in the app, taking advantage of the current WorkManager implementation.

Related #3315 

ACs:

- New check in Camera upload photos/videos called `Upload pictures/videos only when charging`
- If it is checked, all new stuff will be enqueued till device is charging. Proper message to show in the uploads view (`Waiting for charging` or similar) dependingÂ¿?
- If it is unchecked, nothing different will happen. Stuff will be uploaded depending other conditions but not this one
- Pictures and videos will behave separately

1032380646,[MDM] Integrate Android Enterprise in the app,"[EPIC] -> https://github.com/owncloud/android/issues/3398
[SPIKE] -> https://github.com/owncloud/android/issues/3399

The very first step to be able to manage the app via MDM is to introduce Android Enterprise in the app.
In this video playlist they show how to begin with Android Enterprise: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWz5rJ2EKKc-nnQcMIVqAM9_CNmbGu12O
Guide about managed configurations in Android documentation: https://developer.android.com/work/managed-configurations

In our case, it'll be necessary to manage in some way the code that will have to be executed ONLY in the branded apps which use MDM. We discussed 2 different approaches:
- Create a flag variable in `setup.xml` to indicate whether that instance of the app is going to be managed via MDM
- Create a new product flavor so that this code is only executed if the app is built for that variant

For the moment, we are taking the second approach, but more opinions and suggestions are welcome.

### TASKS

- [x] Research
- [x] Create branch feature/mdm
- [x] Development tasks
  - [x] Create new product flavors ""mdmDebug"" and ""mdmRelease""
  - [x] Include the `APP_RESTRICTIONS` meta-data node in the Android manifest 
  - [x] Create a new `managed_configurations.xml` resource file with a `restriction` node for test.
  - [x] Instantiate a `RestrictionsManager` and retrieve the restriction set previously **on app launch**
  - [x] Use the restriction value to do whatever it implies
  - [x] Test it with Test DPC
- [x] Code review and apply changes requested
- [x] Design test plan
- [x] QA
- [ ] Merge branch feature/mdm into master
- [ ] Adapt BitRise workflow for tests

### CHANGES IN BITRISE WORKFLOWS
Since we introduced new flavors in the ""owncloudApp"" module in this issue, it is necessary to adapt workflows in BitRise so that they continue working after merging this into master. The changes performed are summarised in the next points:
- The old workflows ""primary"" (UI and unit tests) are now ""**new_arch**"". As new architecture is being developed in a separate branch, it will be necessary to keep these workflows until a rebase against master is done.
- The new ""**primary**"" workflow is a copy of the old ""primary"", but with some adaptations:
  - In the UI tests workflow, now the apk is assembled for the ""originalDebug"" flavor
  - In the unit tests workflow, now the unit tests in the ""owncloudApp"" module are executed for the ""originalDebug"" flavor, and the ""owncloudApp"" module is assembled for the ""originalDebug"" flavor
- Also, the trigger pattern for the workflows has been changed so that the ""**new_arch**"" workflows are triggered only in branches starting by `new_arch/...`, and ""**primary**"" workflows are triggered in the rest of branches ([here](https://discuss.bitrise.io/t/exclude-one-branch-from-workflow-trigger-pattern/1244) is how to do this). This will be changed once the branch for new architecture rebases against master.

### IMPORTANT POINTS
- For users to be able to use ownCloud app and all its features, they should have some apps installed in the work profile of their devices that are not by default, so that some intents that are launched can be handled by a suitable app (otherwise ownCloud app crashes). This may be responsibility of MDM console administrators (they can usually distribute these apps via the MDM console). The needed apps are:
  - A browser
  - An email client",2021/10/21 11:30,0.9378,gp:AOqpTOGcsP2IXIMtwgW-sApUevtvjJ2oW_hbiBZNGnW1Bw8MeCGevcFAh0qqXaAXRAeFGJsvDXHg5bmlAgWNDPw,The features in the Android app are inferior to those in the iOS app.,2017/3/11 4:55,,,,,,

111917716,Unable to login due to SSL,"Hi!

I run OC 8.1.3 behind an nginx 1.8.0 proxy with php5-fpm and a self signed certificate.
The certificate has been imported as a system cert in android for DavDroid.
Everything including WebDAV and CalDAV runs find except for the OC android app:

Problem: I cannot login due to an unrecognized error.

Question: What could the reason be? Is it a bug in the OC app or has it something to do with my selfsigned certificate?
I created it using 

```
openssl req -nodes -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 -keyout $1.pem -out $1.pem -days 730
```

Here's first the ADB log when I add the following HTTP header:

```

I don't really know where to get the latest apk version of the owncloud client for android; I thought it was http://owncloud.org/support/android/ (at least that's the first hit on the search words ""owncloud android client""), but the one from there is crashing on my phone (Galaxy Nexus running 4.2.1) - at least it shows a ""App crashed"" message box every time when the app starts; after some waiting the app still shows up, but will keep on crashing every minute or so - that's unacceptable for me, and I have seen this behavior before, I'm pretty sure it was fixed in the meantime. When going to the page linked there (http://alefzero.eu/a/) I see ""Last modified: October 10 2012 23:20."", and it also still links to gitorious...

That can't be the current app, can it? If it isn't please at least remove the reference from http://owncloud.org/support/android/ (or point it to wherever the new version is available!
